Description
===========
JRoar is a streaming sever for Ogg(http://xiph.org/ogg/) in pure Java.
JRoar casts live Ogg streams to Ogg Vorbis players as IceCast2
(http://www.icecast.org/) does and shouts live Ogg streams to IceCast2
and JRoar(, but JRoar does not support encoding/re-encoding). 
JRoar also accepts live Ogg streams from Ices.
The uniqueness of JRoar is that JRoar works as a proxy for live Ogg
streams and enables you to share single stream with others. Of course,
its characteristic property is that it is in pure Java. JRoar can be easily
deployed and in fact, it can run on the built-in JVM of IE.


Features
========
  - JRoar casts live Ogg streams to Ogg Vorbis players.
  - JRoar accepts live Ogg streams from shouting systems, like ice.
  - JRoar loads Ogg Vorbis files(Vorbis, Speex, Theora) from the hard disk and 
    casts those contents. (it is still incomplete.)
  - JRoar transfers live Ogg streams to IceCast2 and JRoar in the ICE protocol.
  - JRoar casts Ogg streams on UDP broadcast packets to local subnet.
    This broadcast-stream is only enjoyable by JOrbisPlayer from JOrbis. 
  - JRoar depends on JOrbis(http://www.jcraft.com/jorbis).
  - JRoar is implemented within JDK 1.1.*;
  - JRoar is licensed under GNU GPL.
  - JRoar supports Speex(http://speex.sourceforge.net/), 
    an open-source (LGPL) patent-free voice codec.

Why JRoar is hacked?
====================
First of all, JRoar must not be a competitor for IceCast2,Ices,etc.
and there are no intentions to replace them with JRoar. Needless to
say, JRoar has many disadvantages , for example, JRoar can not support 
encoding/re-encoding and will not run faster than them, because it is
in pure Java. However, it is easily deployed and will enable you to share Ogg
streams with other. We have imagined to deploy JRoar all over the world
and to construct Ogg stream networks in p2p style. Of course, JRoar is just a
easily deployed proxy server for Ogg, so there must be some mechanism
to plug several JRoars efficiently. but we hope some of p2p systems may help
us. How do you feel this vision?


UDP Broadcast
=============
JRoar will cast Ogg streams on UDP broadcast packets to the local subnet.
Please note that these UDP packets don't depend on any formal
specifications like a specification for Vorbis/RTP.
In current implementation, Ogg packets are thrown to the local subnet
in UDP packets without any trick. These packets are only enjoyable 
by JOrbisPlayer, which is included in JOribs 0.0.10 or later.
If you access to the mount point for UDP broadcast on JRoar by JOrbisPlayer,
JOrbisPlayer will get some Ogg packets which include comments and
CodeBooks for playing currently streamed sound and the port number for
UDP via HTTP protocol. The UDP port number will be given in returned HTTP
header 'udp-port'. Then it will listen to UDP port and start to play sounds. 
Please refer to 'Options' section in this document to register mount
points for UDP broadcasting.
We hope that this ad-hock and quick hack will motivate to improve
broadcasting systems and specifications in this area.


How To Enjoy
============
Extract the archive jroar-*.zip at http://www.jcraft.com/jroar/ .

  $ cd jroar-*
  $ java com.jcraft.jroar.JRoar
If you are in the inside of fire-wall and the http proxy server is running at
192.168.0.3:80, add options as follows,
  $ java -Dhttp.proxyHost=192.168.0.3 -Dhttp.proxyPort=80 com.jcraft.jroar.JRoar

Suppose that your machine has ip-address, 192.168.0.2. In this case,
JRoar will wait for your requests at http://192.168.0.2:8000/ .
The most simply way to use JRoar as a proxy, open following URL,
  http://192.168.0.2:8000/mount?mountpoint=/test.ogg&source=http://somewhere/
by Winamp or other Ogg Vorbis player. If Ogg Vorbis stream is available at
http://somewhere/, your player will start to play.
Now, if you open 
  http://192.168.0.2:8000/test.ogg 
from other box by Ogg Vorbis player, you will be able to enjoy same stream.

As another way to enjoy this shared stream, try to visit 
  http://192.168.0.2:8000/
from other box by a web browser, for example, IE.
You will find the anchor on the text '/test.ogg'. If the Ogg Vorbis
player is correctly installed on your system, you can enjoy again that
shared stream by just clicking '/test.ogg'. 
On this web page, you can also add another mount point.


Customising The Web Interface
=============================
By extending 'com.jcraft.jroar.UserPage' class, you can add pages
to the web interface. For example, if you have 'MyPage' class, which
extends com.jcraft.jroar.UserPage, try as follows,
  java com.jcraft.jroar.JRoar -page MyPage /test.htm
You will see the new page at http://localhost:8000/test.htm .
There is a sample under 'misc' directory.


Relaying Ogg Vorbis Streams from PeerCast
=========================================
JRoar will relay Ogg Vorbis streams from PeerCast(http://www.peercast.org).
For example, try
  $ java com.jcraft.jroar.JRoar \
       -peercast-host connect1.peercast.org:7144 \
       -relay /test.ogg peercast://pls/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.pls
, where 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' should be peercast-ID. 


Options
=======
JRoar accepts following options in running as an application,

  -port     port-number (default: 8000)
  -ipaddress my-address
  -relay    mount-point  url-of-source
  -page     page-name class-name
  -passwd   password-for-web-interface
  -icepasswd password-for-ICE
  -playlist mount-point  filename 
  -mplistener class-name
  -shout    src-mount-point ip-address port-number password  dst-mount-point
  -udp      src-mount-point broadcast-address port-number dst-mount-point
  -peercast-host  peercast-lookup-host (default: localhost:7144)

For example, 
  $ find ~/my_ogg_files -name "*.ogg" -print  > /tmp/foo
  $ java com.jcraft.jroar.JRoar -port 9000
                                -playlist /test1.ogg /tmp/foo \
                                -relay /test2.ogg http://somewhere/test.ogg \
                                -udp /test1.ogg 192.168.0.255 8000 /test3.ogg \
                                -udp /test2.ogg 192.168.0.255 8001 /test4.ogg 
/test3,ogg, /test4.ogg are only enjoyable by JOrbisPlayer from JOrbis 0.0.10.
If you have JOrbisPlayer, try to access http://your_box:9000/test3.ogg  .
If you don't have it, but you have the J2SE Java plug-in,
try to open following URL by the web browser,
  http://www.jcraft.com/jorbis/player/JOrbisPlayer.php?play=http://your_box:9000/test4.ogg
The JOrbisPlayer applet signed digitally by JCraft will be downloaded
and play the Ogg Vorbis stream on UDP broadcast packets, which is
originally from http://somewhere/test.ogg .
